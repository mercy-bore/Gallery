This is a web app with random photos.

## BDD
A user of the application should be able to:

- View different photos that interest me.
- Click on a single photo to expand it and also view the details of the photo. The photo details must appear on a modal within the same route as the main page.
- Search for different categories of photos. (ie. Travel, Food)
- Copy a link to the photo to share with my friends.
- View photos based on the location they were taken.
